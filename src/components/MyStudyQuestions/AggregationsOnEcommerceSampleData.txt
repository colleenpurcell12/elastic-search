This exercise uses Kibana's ecommerce data set to practice queries and aggregations, fix the index mapping by setting up a new index

First Step: get some sample data for the exam prep questions below
Add Data to Kibana --> Sample eCommerce orders --> click "Add Data"

Verify that it's in your list of indices
GET _cat/indices?v

Explore the data
GET kibana_sample_data_ecommerce/_mapping
GET kibana_sample_data_ecommerce/_search?size=1

There are 4675 documents in the index
Main fields in _source are category

first lets reindex the dataset into our own index
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "kibana_sample_data_ecommerce"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "store_transactions"
  }
}

If it fails due to a auto_create_index error run this first:
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "action.auto_create_index": true
  }
}
