Section: Ingest Pipeline

First let's create a index to edit. Create a new index called cheap_transactions as a subset of store_transactions, of all the transactions worth less than $20 euro.

POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "store_transactions",
    "query": {
      "range": {
        "taxful_total_price": {
          "lte": 20
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "cheap_transactions"
  }
}

GET cheap_transactions/_search
GET cheap_transactions/_mapping

Now let's create an ingest pipeline to update it. It should
- be named edit_cheap_transactions
- remove the taxless_total_price field
- for every sku change the prefix from ZO to EX
- change the type of day_of_week_i field to integer

PUT _ingest/pipeline/edit_cheap_transactions
{
  "description": "removestaxless_total_price, adds % to each product's discount perc, changes type day_of_week to int",
  "processors": [
    {
      "convert": {
        "field": "day_of_week_i",
        "type": "integer"
      }
    },
    {
      "remove": {
        "field": "taxless_total_price"
      }
    },
    {
      "foreach": {
        "field": "sku",
        "processor": {
          "gsub": {
            "field" : "_ingest._value",
            "pattern": "ZO",
            "replacement": "EX"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Use the pipeline in an update by query
POST cheap_transactions/_update_by_query?pipeline=edit_cheap_transactions

Verify that the changes were made
GET cheap_transactions/_search?size=10
