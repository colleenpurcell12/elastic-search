Section: Reindex

Let's create a new index named monday_transactions for all the transactions that were on a Monday, and the new index should no longer have the field day_of_week, and it should have a new field called is_big_purchase that's set to true if the total_quantity is more than 2, otherwise it should be false

GET _cat/indices?v&h=index&s=index


POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "store_transactions",
    "query": {
      "match": {
        "day_of_week": "Monday"
      }
    }
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "monday_transactions"
  },
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.remove('day_of_week'); if (ctx._source.total_quantity >2) {ctx._source.is_big_purchase = true; } else {ctx._source.is_big_purchase = false;}",
    "lang": "painless"
  }
}

GET monday_transactions/_search


Section: update_by_query

On all documents add field called is_in_MENA that is true if city_name is Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Cairo

Answer
POST store_transactions/_update_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "geoip.city_name": "Dubai"
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "geoip.city_name": "Abu Dhabi"
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "geoip.city_name": "Cairo"
          }
        }
      ],
      "minimum_should_match": 1
    }
  },
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.is_in_MENA = true"
  }
}

Now verify that it worked properly
GET store_transactions/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "geoip.city_name": "Dubai"
    }
  }
}
Yes --> "is_in_MENA" : true

GET store_transactions/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "geoip.city_name": "New York"
    }
  }
}
Yes, doesnt have the field
