Section: Dynamic Templates

Create a index named test_dynam_template that maps field names matching the pattern _code to keyword, and all other strings to both text and keyword

Answer
PUT test_dynam_template
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic_templates": [
      {
        "codes": {
          "match_mapping_type": "string",
          "match": "*_code",
          "mapping": {
            "type": "keyword"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "strings": {
          "match_mapping_type": "string",
          "unmatch": "*_code",
          "mapping": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
              "keyword": {
                "type": "keyword"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Now test the new index's dynamic mapping by adding this document

POST test_dynam_template/_doc
{
  "transaction_code": "12345",
  "title": "purchase"
}

Verify that transaction_code was mapped as a type keyword field and title was mapped as both text and keyword

Answer
GET test_dynam_template
