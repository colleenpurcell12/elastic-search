                In the exam, when you enter your query answers from Kibana for
                submission you EXCLUDE the request and only include the JSON
                request body so make sure you know how not to rely on request
                params like ?size=0 and ?pipeline=my_pipeline for things like
                _update_by_query

              <li>
                Watch out about hot/warm architecture because it's not exactly
                in the docs, configuring nodes' size attribute is though so you
                can infer from there.

              Blog post about questions on his exam: first task was cluster
              setup leveraging hot-warm nodes. Easy-peasy, ssh to each node, set
              elasticsearch.yml with correct properties and run elasticsearch
              process. Five minutes including double-check of node attributes
              through Kibana. That was ego booster and stress reliever at the
              same time, so I went to next task; again some cluster propertiesâ€¦
              nothing that might surprise me. At the second half, the nature of
              tasks switched to operations with indexed data. I had to modify
              already indexed data; of course, I used ingest pipeline and
              Reindex API. Another task, create some custom analyzer and also
              one or two tasks about queries, nothing horrible just some
              aggregations and bool queries. More from this blog post{" "}

              When searching in documentation, instead of searching by keyword
              like "and operator" or "query operator" try using exact query
              syntax like "operator": "and" to get a direct hit!
