EXAM PREP: The index operation can also be executed without specifying the _id. In such a case, you use a POST instead of a PUT and an _id will be generated automatically. Index the following document without an id and check the _id in the response. (Make sure you use POST.)

  "id": "57",
  "title": "Phrase Queries: a world without Stopwords",
  "date":"March 7, 2016",

EXAM PREP: Modify your multi_match query by giving the title field a boost of 2. How does the score of the top hit compare to the previous query without the boost?


GET my_blogs/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "open source",
      "fields": [
        "title^2",
        "content"
      ]
    }
  }
}


EXAM PREP: Boost affects the score without impacting recall or precision. Remove the boost and modify your multi_match query --> to perform a phrase query, which increases precision (perhaps at the expense of recall). Did the increase in precision return more or fewer hits?

GET my_blogs/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "open source",
      "fields": [
        "title",
        "content"
      ],
      "type": "phrase"
    }
  }
}
EXAM PREP: Try increasing the recall (perhaps at the expense of precision) by adding the fuzziness parameter, permitting a maximum of 2 edits per word. Did the increased recall return more of fewer hits? How relevant are they?

Lab 2.3
EXAM PREP: It looks like releases usually come with performance optimizations and improvements. Assuming that you are not interested in upgrading your deployment, change the previous query (the should version) so that it 

must_not contain "released" or "releases" or "release" in the title field. 

Your top hits look better now, and notice the number of total hits dropping down to 47.

GET blogs/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "released releasesrelease"
          }
        }
      ], 
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "content": "performance"

        {
          "match": {
            "content": "optimizations"
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "content": "improvements"
          }
        }
      ],
      "minimum_should_match": 2
    }
  }
}

EXAM PREP: In the previous query, let’s say you are more interested in blogs about Elasticsearch. How could you rank the results so that the documents that mention 

"elasticsearch" in the title score higher? (TIP: you must have two separate should clauses. One clause with a minimum_should_match will work like a must. The other clause will influence the score.)

GET blogs/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [

                "content": "performance"
              }
            },
            {
              "match": {
                "content": "optimizations"

            },
            {
              "match": {
                "content": "improvements"
              }
            }
          ],
          "minimum_should_match": 2
          }
          
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "elasticsearch"
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {

EXAM PREP: Next, imagine the user also selected Culture on the left side bar. Update the query above to add the new user selection. The result should be 7 documents. (TIP: you need to implement an OR logic combined with an AND logic. Which boolean query allows you to run ORs?)

that matches all unmapped fields with a value of JSON type string

and maps those as type keyword

PUT logs_fixed

A field named all_feedback of type text

A field named instructor_feedback of type text that gets copied to the all_feedback field

A field named labs_feedback of type text that is also copied to the all_feedback field

A field named course_rating of type integer in which null values default to 1, and also has coercion disabled

EXAM PREP: Then, configure the node settings in the appropriate config files (either elasticsearch.yml or jvm.options) to have the following:

it joins my_cluster

the name of the node is node3

binds and publishes both the transport and HTTP protocols to the site-local address

set the min and max heap size to 512m

cluster.name: my_cluster
node.name: node3
network.host: _site_

-Xms512m
-Xmx512m


EXAM PREP: Next, update the node settings to have the following:

node1 is the only initial master node in the cluster

it discovers the cluster via server1, server2, or server3

cluster.initial_master_nodes: node1
