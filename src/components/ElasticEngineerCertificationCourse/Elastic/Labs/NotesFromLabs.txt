Doing labs from Scratch with only ES Documentation

Lab 2
in CLI: 
ssh server1
GET /
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/"

you can "Copy As Curl" in wrench icon in Kibana


curl -XGET "http://server1:9200/_mget" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{    "docs" : [        {            "_index" : "my_blogs2",            "_id" : "3"        },        {            "_index" : "my_blogs2",            "_id" : "2"        }    ]}'


MEMORIZE THIS cause the docs provide poor examples

Which blogs have a content field that includes at least 2 of the terms performance or optimizations or improvements?

GET blogs/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "content": "performance"
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "content": "optimizations"
          }
        },
        {
          "match": {
            "content": "improvements"
          }
        }
      ],
      "minimum_should_match": 2
    }
  }
}
