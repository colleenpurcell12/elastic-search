Lab 4.3: Topology Awareness

GET _cat/nodes?v&s=name
GET _cat/nodeattrs?v&s=name

Use command below to see if there Are  copies of the same shard (both primary and replica shard) 
allocated to the same rack
SOMETIMES YES cause we havent forced it to not replicate on a rack

GET _cat/shards?h=index,shard,prirep,node&s=index,prirep

Implement shard allocation awareness with the following
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "transient": {
    "cluster": {
      "routing": {
        "allocation.awareness.attributes": "my_rack"
      }
    }
  }
}

GET _cat/shards?h=index,shard,prirep,node&s=index,prirep

now explicitly set the cluster to not duplicate more than one copy over to a single rack (of multiple nodes)

PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster": {
      "routing": {
        "allocation.awareness.attributes": "my_rack",
        "allocation.awareness.force.my_rack.values": "rack1,rack2"
      }
    }
  }
}
GET _cat/shards?h=index,shard,prirep,node&s=index,prirep


--> basically there was no point in making copies of the primary shards 
(replicas) on the same rack, so when node2/node4 were down, 
no replicas got recreated on node1/node3
