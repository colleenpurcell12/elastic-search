EXAM PREP: Keep digging it. Figure out which index is red and which shard is unassigned. Feel free to use the _cluster or _cat APIs.

GET _cluster/health
GET _cluster/health/nested_blogs?level=shards
GET _cat/indices/nested_blogs?v

EXAM PREP: Now that we know which shard has the issue, use the Cluster Allocation Explain API to understand it. Can you discover what the problem is?

GET _cluster/allocation/explain
==> the shard cannot be allocated to the same node on which a copy of the shard already exists
