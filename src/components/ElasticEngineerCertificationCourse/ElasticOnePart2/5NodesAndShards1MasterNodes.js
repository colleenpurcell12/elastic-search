          HTTP vs. Transport Communication
          <br />
          HTTP is the exposed APIs, and transportation layer which is how nodes
          communicate with eachother in the back end
          <br />
          HTTP is bound to localhost by default and can be set explicitly with
          http.host, default port 9200 and can be set with http.port
          <br />
          Transport is bound to localhost by default and can be set explicitly
          with http.host, default port 9200 and can be set with http.port

            It's how a node knows which other nodes are in the cluster, via SEED

            You can get it with <code>GET _cluster/state</code>

            it has the mappings, settings, shard allocation, and indices

          <div className="answer">
            First it has to be configured as master eligible as node.master:
            true in yml.
            <br />
            Then it has to be elected. Has to be enough nodes to break a tied
            vote to avoid split brain (two master nodes, aka two cluster state
            managers)
            <br />
            Cluster state has a list of voting node ids. If there is an even
            amount of master-eligible nodes, one will automatically be left off
            the list. (kind cool)
