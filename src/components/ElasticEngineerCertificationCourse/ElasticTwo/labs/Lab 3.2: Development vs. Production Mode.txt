Lab 3.2: Development vs. Production Mode

If you run an aggs query (with size set to 0) then it will auto cache, 
so it you run it over and over again, it will get faster.
8830 --> 3168 --> 54


to disable caching and slow down subsequent searched set request_cache to false
GET logs_*/_search?request_cache=false

6500 --> 2700 --> 3656 --> 4293

another way to disable caching is by setting size > 0 cause queries arent cached, 
while pure aggregations (without queries) are.

you can override the caching of a query with an aggregation by setting 
request_cache to tru


no caching, slow
GET logs_*/_search?request_cache=false
{
  "size": 0,
  ...

yes caching, fast
GET logs_*/_search?request_cache=true
{
  "size": 10,
  ...
  
slow by default
GET logs_*/_search
{
  "size": 10,

gets faster by default
GET logs_*/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "NAME": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "geoip.country_name.keyword",
        "size": 100
      },
      "aggs": {
        "NAME": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "geoip.region_name.keyword",
            "size": 100
          },
          "aggs": {
            "NAME": {
              "terms": {
                "field": "geoip.city_name.keyword",
                "size": 1
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
